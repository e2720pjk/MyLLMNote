# Fix History Disappearing on Resize

## Goal Description
Fix the issue where chat history disappears when the terminal window is resized. This is caused by the `Static` component in [MainContent.tsx](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/gemini-cli/packages/cli/src/ui/components/MainContent.tsx) not re-rendering when the terminal is cleared and redrawn.

## Proposed Changes

### UI Components

#### [MODIFY] [MainContent.tsx](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-3/packages/cli/src/ui/components/MainContent.tsx)
- Add `key={uiState.staticKey}` to the `<Static>` component.
- This ensures that when [AppContainer](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/gemini-cli/packages/cli/src/ui/AppContainer.tsx#155-1663) updates `staticKey` (which it does on resize), `Static` remounts and reprints the history.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run lint` to ensure no regressions.

### Manual Verification
- Resize the terminal window while the app is running.
- Verify that the chat history persists and is redrawn correctly.
