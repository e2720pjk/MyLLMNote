# Walkthrough - Fix Input Prompt Misalignment & Height Calculation Stability

## Goal
Fix the vertical misalignment of the input prompt in `llxprt-code-4` and stabilize the dynamic height calculation to prevent UI jitter and overlap.

## Changes

### 1. Input Prompt Misalignment
- **File:** [packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.tsx](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-3/packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.tsx)
- **Issue:** The prompt text was rendering one line below the `>` symbol due to an extra newline in the [Text](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-4/packages/cli/src/ui/components/shared/MaxSizedBox.tsx#206-210) component.
- **Fix:** Removed the newline and ensured `flexDirection="row"` alignment.

### 2. Height Calculation Stability
- **File:** [packages/cli/src/ui/AppContainer.tsx](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/gemini-cli/packages/cli/src/ui/AppContainer.tsx)
- **Issue:**
    - `llxprt-code-2` was stable but static (only updated on resize), causing overflow with dynamic panels.
    - `llxprt-code-4` (initial fix) was dynamic but prone to jitter loops.
    - **Regression:** Debug Console and TodoPanel overlapped with Footer because their height changes were ignored.
- **Fix:** Aligned with `gemini-cli` strategy + `llxprt` support + Debug awareness.
    - Updated `useLayoutEffect` dependency array to:
      `[buffer, terminalHeight, terminalWidth, settings.merged.showTodoPanel, showErrorDetails, consoleMessages.length]`.
    - **Why:**
        - `buffer`: Updates height when user types (Composer grows).
        - `showTodoPanel`: Updates height when TodoPanel toggles.
        - `showErrorDetails`: Updates height when Debug Console opens/closes.
        - `consoleMessages.length`: Updates height when new debug logs arrive (preventing overlap).
        - `terminalHeight/Width`: Updates on resize.
        - **Stability:** During LLM streaming (without debug logs), `buffer` is constant, so height is NOT recalculated, preventing jitter.

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- `npm run lint`: Passed.
- `npm run typecheck`: Passed.
- `npm run test`: Passed.

### Manual Verification
- **Typing:** Input box grows, footer adjusts correctly.
- **TodoPanel:** Toggling panel adjusts footer height correctly.
- **Debug Console:** Opening/Closing and receiving logs adjusts footer height correctly (no overlap).
- **Streaming:** UI remains stable (no jitter) while LLM outputs text.
