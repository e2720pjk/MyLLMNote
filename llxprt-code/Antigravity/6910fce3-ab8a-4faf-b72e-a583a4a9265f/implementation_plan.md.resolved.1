# Progress Report and PR Documentation Plan

This plan outlines the creation of two key documents: a new [PR.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code/PR.md) for the `llxprt-code` branch (old branch) and a comprehensive `progress.md` (Progress Report) to share with other developers.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation & Procedures

#### [NEW] [FIBER_RECORDER_DEPLOY.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/FIBER_RECORDER_DEPLOY.md)
Provide manual steps for the user to publish the `fiber-recorder` directory as a new GitHub repository using the `gh` CLI.

#### [MODIFY] [UI_OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/UI_OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS.md)
Refine the progress report to be more "public-facing":
- Replace `llxprt-code` with "Stable Implementation (PR Draft)".
- Replace `llxprt-code-4` with "Latest Port (PR #43)".
- Replace local [SOT.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/SOT.md) references with a placeholder for the Fiber Recorder repository URL.
- Focus on the "Fiber Recorder" as a standalone tool for unblocking the UI stasis.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Ensure `FIBER_RECORDER_DEPLOY.md` steps are clear and safe.
- Verify [UI_OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/UI_OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS.md) no longer contains local-only naming.
