# Progress Report and PR Documentation Plan

This plan outlines the creation of two key documents: a new `PR.md` for the `llxprt-code` branch (old branch) and a comprehensive `progress.md` (Progress Report) to share with other developers.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation & Procedures

#### [NEW] [FIBER_RECORDER_DEPLOY.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/FIBER_RECORDER_DEPLOY.md)
Provide manual steps for the user to publish the `fiber-recorder` directory as a new GitHub repository using the `gh` CLI.

#### [MODIFY] [UI_OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/UI_OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS.md)
Refine the progress report to be more "experimental" and "humble":
- Tone down "Roadmap" items to "Current Experiments".
- Explicitly state that we are trying to use Fiber Recorder to reach the quality of the stable baseline.
- Remove marketing-style language.
- Invite discussion and analysis on existing results.
- Ensure the repository URL for `fiber-recorder` is correctly reflected.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Ensure `FIBER_RECORDER_DEPLOY.md` steps are clear and safe.
- Verify `UI_OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS.md` no longer contains local-only naming.
