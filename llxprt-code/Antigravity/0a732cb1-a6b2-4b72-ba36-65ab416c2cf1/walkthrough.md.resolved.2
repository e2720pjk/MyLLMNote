# Walkthrough - IME Ctrl+C & Deadlock Fix

## Changes

### CLI

#### [AppContainer.tsx](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-3/packages/cli/src/ui/AppContainer.tsx)

-   Added `await runExitCleanup()` before `process.exit(0)` in the `useEffect` hook that handles `quittingMessages`.
-   This ensures that when the application exits via the `/quit` command or the IME-mapped `Ctrl+C` path, the terminal is correctly restored.

#### [gemini.tsx](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-3/packages/cli/src/gemini.tsx)

-   Updated [registerCleanup](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-3/packages/cli/src/utils/cleanup.ts#14-17) to fix a deadlock where the cleanup handler waited for the process to exit before unmounting the UI.
-   **Optimization**: Removed `await instance.waitUntilExit()` entirely as it was found to hang during explicit exit.
-   Replaced with: `instance.unmount()` -> `await 10ms` (flush) -> `instance.clear()`.
-   This ensures immediate exit without the 5-second timeout delay.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please perform the following steps to verify the fixes:

1.  **Command Quit Test (Optimization Fix)**:
    -   Launch the CLI: `npm run dev` (or equivalent).
    -   Run `/quit`.
    -   **Expected Result**: The CLI should exit **immediately** (no 5s delay).

2.  **IME Ctrl+C Test (Terminal Corruption Fix)**:
    -   Launch the CLI.
    -   Enable an IME (e.g., Chinese/Japanese).
    -   Press `Ctrl+C` (which generates the mapped sequence).
    -   **Expected Result**: The CLI should exit *cleanly*. The terminal cursor should be visible, and typing should echo characters.

3.  **Standard Ctrl+C Test**:
    -   Launch the CLI.
    -   Press standard `Ctrl+C`.
    -   **Expected Result**: Clean exit.
