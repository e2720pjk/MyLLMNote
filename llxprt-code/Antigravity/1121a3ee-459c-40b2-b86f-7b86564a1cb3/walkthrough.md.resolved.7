# UI Layout Restoration and Log Centralization Walkthrough

This walkthrough documents the successful restoration of the UI layout and the centralization of console logs within the new tabbed interface.

## Key Improvements

### 1. TabBar Repositioning
The [TabBar](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code/packages/cli/src/ui/components/TabBar.tsx#19-61) (and its screen reader equivalent) has been moved to the bottom of the main content area. This provides a more traditional and stable layout, keeping the active content as the primary focus while tab controls remain easily accessible at the base.

### 2. Persistent Footer
The [Footer](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-4/packages/cli/src/ui/components/Footer.tsx#25-49) is now always visible, regardless of whether the user is actively typing in the composer. This ensures that critical status metrics like model name, token counts, and memory usage are always available for at-a-glance monitoring, matching the behavior of the [main](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-4/scripts/oldui-tmux-harness.js#951-1202) branch.

### 3. Centralized Debug Tab
All debug-related information has been consolidated into the **Debug** tab:
- **Early Log Preservation**: Logs generated during the application's boot-up process (via `earlyLogBuffer`) are now marked with an `isEarly` flag and explicitly displayed *before* the [AppHeader](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code/packages/cli/src/ui/components/AppHeader.tsx#18-33) in both Chat and Debug tabs.
- **Virtualization Height Fix**: Resolved the header/list collapse issue by setting an explicit container height for [MainContent](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code/packages/cli/src/ui/components/MainContent.tsx#57-395) based on the available terminal height, ensuring the virtualized window remains stable.
- **Migration of Debug Elements**: The [DebugProfiler](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-4/packages/cli/src/ui/components/DebugProfiler.tsx#119-200) (render/idle frame tracking) and [ConsoleSummaryDisplay](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-4/packages/cli/src/ui/components/ConsoleSummaryDisplay.tsx#16-36) (error counts) have been moved from the global Footer into the Debug tab.
- **Deprecated Component Removal**: The `DetailedMessagesDisplay` component has been removed as its functionality is now fully superseded by the dedicated Debug tab.

## Verification Results

### Automated Checks
The following checks were performed and passed:
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run format`
- `npm run typecheck`

### Functional Validation
- **Screen Reader Mode**: Verified that input remains functional and tab indicators are correctly rendered.
- **DEBUG=true Mode**: Verified that the [DebugProfiler](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/llxprt-code-4/packages/cli/src/ui/components/DebugProfiler.tsx#119-200) and debug messages correctly appear within the new tabbed structure when debug mode is active.
- **Layout Stability**: Verified that the TabBar correctly pins to the bottom and the content area scales appropriately.
