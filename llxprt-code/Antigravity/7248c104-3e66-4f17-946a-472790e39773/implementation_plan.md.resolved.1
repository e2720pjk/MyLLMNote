# Implementation Plan: Code Comment Reinforcement (CCR)

Create a concise rule to force AI agents to justify code changes via English comments.

## Proposed Changes

### Configuration Layer

#### [NEW] [code-comment-reinforcement.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/.gemini/antigravity/playground/distant-intergalactic/.agent/rules/code-comment-reinforcement.md)
A rule file containing structured instructions for code commentary.

- **Objective**: Use structured comments (Relation/Reason) for all logic changes.
- **Rules**:
    - Every logical modification must have a comment.
    - Comments must explain: 1. **Why** (Reason) and 2. **Relation** to core logic.
    - **Language**: Rule is in Chinese, but **Output Comments MUST be English**.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify the rule file exists and reflects the concise bullet points.
- Provide a usage example in the walkthrough.
