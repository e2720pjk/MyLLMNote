# Implementation Plan: Code Comment Reinforcement Rule

This plan outlines the creation of a general rule to enforce meaningful code comments that explain the "why" and "how" of changes, ensuring consistency and auditability.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The rule itself will be written in **Chinese**, but it will explicitly mandate that all generated code comments and documentation must be in **English** for cross-project compatibility.

## Proposed Changes

### Configuration / Rule Layer

#### [NEW] [code-comment-reinforcement.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/.gemini/antigravity/playground/distant-intergalactic/.agent/rules/code-comment-reinforcement.md)
Create a new rule file that defines the "Code Comment Reinforcement" (CCR) policy.

- **Objective**: Ensure every logic change is justified and connected to the core system.
- **Requirement**: AI must include comments explaining the "Relation" and "Reason" for each modification.
- **Language**: Rule is in Chinese; Output comments MUST be in English.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Review the generated rule content to ensure it matches the user's conceptual requirements.
- Simulate an AI response following this rule to verify the output format.
