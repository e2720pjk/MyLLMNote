# Create Version-Change-report.md

Create a new file `Version-Change-report.md` summarizing changes since `v0.1.0` on the `opencode-dev` branch, following the TLDR and Dive Deeper format.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation

#### [NEW] [Version-Change-report.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/CodeWiki/Version-Change-report.md)
Create the file with the following structure:

- **TLDR**: Overall summary of performance, robustness, and configuration improvements.
- **Dive Deeper**: Detailed list of categorized changes.

**功能 (Features)**
- Added actual API timing measurement for agent performance tracking (`bd119a2`).
- Added token usage tracking for agent operations (`2bf0003`).
- Implemented token tracking for LLM API calls (`5c5ddf8`).
- Added comprehensive configuration validation (`363dafd`).
- Parallel processing for documentation generation (`6c3f332`).
- Configurable file limits functionality (`b3a5ba4`).
- Added `--respect-gitignore` option (`861cb8e`).
- Added GitHub templates and opencode workflow (`790464b`).

**調整 (Adjustments)**
- Improved robustness and error handling in core components (`aedf4e7`).
- Converted cache concurrency tests from threading to async (`a71b16b`).
- Optimized module processing and performance tracking (`47f8f14`).
- Fix: resolve async locking, exception handling, and magic number issues (`96f2162`).
- Corrected `working_dir` default to 'docs' (`d13dd15`).
- Refactored AnalysisOptions and GenerationOptions (`06893d6`).
- Reformatted codebase for consistency (`436545b`).
- Standardized string quoting and formatting (`db4ecca`).
- CI update: switched model to glm-4.7-free (`cab22ae`).
- Various fixes for thread safety, type validation, and uninitialized variables.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Review the new `Version-Change-report.md` to ensure it follows the requested format.
- Confirm that upstream merges and unmerged branches are excluded.
