# Walkthrough - Creating Version-Change-report.md

I have created a new version change report summarizing the evolution of CodeWiki from version `v0.1.0` to `v0.1.5` on the `opencode-dev` branch.

## Changes Made

### Documentation
#### [NEW] [Version-Change-report.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/CodeWiki/Version-Change-report.md)
- **TLDR Section**: Provides a high-level overview of the major improvements in performance, observability, and architecture.
- **Dive Deeper Section**: Categorizes changes into **功能 (Features)** and **調整 (Adjustments)**.
    - Features include: Parallel processing engine, Performance tracking, Token usage counter, Gitignore integration, and Fallback mechanisms.
    - Adjustments include: Configuration model decoupling, codebase-wide reformatting, import optimization, and enhanced error handling.

## Verification Results

### Git Log Analysis
- Verified all commits from `v0.1.0` to `bd119a2` (HEAD of `opencode-dev`).
- Excluded upstream merges (`github/main`) and unmerged branches as per instructions.

### Format Check
- Confirmed the file follows the requested **TLDR** and **Dive Deeper** structure.
- Ensured clear categorization of features and adjustments.
