# Refine Version-Change-report.md (English)

Update `Version-Change-report.md` to be entirely in English, include the version evolution timeline, and ensure it correctly reflects all changes since `v0.1.0` while excluding CI-specific model updates.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation

#### [MODIFY] [Version-Change-report.md](file:///Users/caishanghong/Shopify/cli-tool/CodeWiki/Version-Change-report.md)
Update the file with the following English content:

- **TLDR**: Overall summary of performance, robustness, and architecture.
- **Dive Deeper**:
    - **Release Evolution Timeline**: History of versions from `v0.1.0` to `v0.1.5`.
    - **Features**: List of new functionalities (parallel engine, performance tracking, etc.).
    - **Adjustments**: List of refactors and fixes.

**Exclusions**:
- Removed CI model update (`cab22ae`) as per user request.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Review the file to ensure it is entirely in English.
- Confirm the inclusion of the version timeline.
- Verify that the CI model change is absent.
