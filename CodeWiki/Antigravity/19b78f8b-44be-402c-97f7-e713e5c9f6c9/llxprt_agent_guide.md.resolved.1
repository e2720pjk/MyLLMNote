# LLxprt Agent Interface

## 1. Role & Responsibility

**LLxprt** is your specialized delegate for **Code Modification and Generation**.

- **You (The Agent)**: Handle planning, analysis, file reading, and command execution.
- **LLxprt (The Delegate)**: Handles the actual writing and editing of code files.

## 2. Delegation Decision Tree

Use this logic to decide when to call `llxprt`:

```text
User Request
    ├── Needs to write/modify code? → **DELEGATE TO LLXPRT**
    ├── Needs to execute commands/tests/build? → Handle yourself
    ├── Needs to read files? → Handle yourself
    ├── Needs to plan? → Handle yourself
    ├── Needs project analysis? → Handle yourself
    └── Concept discussion/suggestions? → Handle yourself
```

## 3. Invocation Protocol

To delegate a task, execute the `llxprt` command with a single natural language prompt.

**Syntax:**
```bash
llxprt "Your detailed instruction here"
```

### Context Rules
You **MUST** explicitly provide file context using the `@filename` syntax within the prompt string. `llxprt` will resolve these locally.

- **Correct**: `llxprt "Add error handling to @src/utils.ts"`
- **Incorrect**: `llxprt "Add error handling to the utils file"` (LLxprt won't see the code)

## 4. Examples

### Scenario: Refactoring
**User**: "Refactor the login function to use async/await."
**Action**:
```bash
llxprt "Refactor the login function in @src/auth/login.ts to use async/await syntax. Ensure backward compatibility."
```

### Scenario: Bug Fix
**User**: "Fix the null pointer in the user service."
**Action**:
```bash
llxprt "Fix the potential null pointer exception in @src/services/userService.ts when 'user' is undefined."
```

### Scenario: New Feature
**User**: "Create a new button component."
**Action**:
```bash
llxprt "Create a new React component named 'Button' in @src/components/Button.tsx. It should accept 'label' and 'onClick' props."
```

## 5. Important Notes
- **One Shot**: `llxprt` performs the task and exits. It does not maintain a conversation history. Include ALL necessary instructions in the prompt.
- **No Configuration**: Do not attempt to configure models or settings via flags. Assume the environment is correctly pre-configured.
